**Timeline of our project:
- Ryan and Daniel brainstormed the workload and methods on an IPad
- Then Daniel worked on scraping the csv file while Ryan worked on the Student Class
- Ryan also outlined a method for formatting the finished product
- Daniel finished scraping the data into a Student array while Ryan finished up working on totaling the wantedness of each seminar
- Ryan and Daniel then brainstormed with some other groups on ways to tackle the actual assigning of students to a seminar with minimal conflicts
- With the help of Ryan's code, Daniel came up with the idea and began working on the actual implementation
- Daniel finished the scheduling and titied up the program
